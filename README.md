# Hello! Buenas que tal! <img src="https://slackmojis.com/emojis/34304-zzz_cat/download" width="26"/>

My name is Geovanni a full-stack developer and aspiring SWE based in Boston, MA.

Iâ€™m passionate about serving my community and building systems that create real impact,
from robotics to software, with strong problem-solving and collaborative skills.

Apart from coding, my interests span from gaming, music, gym, traveling, to even playing 
trading card games (TCG)! My current favorite TCG is One Piece.
